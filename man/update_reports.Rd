\usage{
update_reports(factory = getwd(), all = FALSE, quiet = TRUE,
  encoding = "UTF-8", ignore_archive = TRUE,
  clean_report_sources = FALSE, remove_cache = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{factory}{the path to a report factory; defaults to the current working
directory}

\item{all}{a logical indicating if all reports should be compiled; it
defaults to \code{FALSE}, in which case only the latest versions of each
reports will be compuled.}

\item{quiet}{a logical indicating if messages from rmarkdown compilation
should be displayed; \code{FALSE} by default.}

\item{encoding}{a character string indicating which encoding should be used
when compiling the document; defaults to `"UTF-8"`, which ensures that
non-ascii characters work across different systems}

\item{ignore_archive}{when \code{TRUE}, any reports within an `_archive` 
sub-directory are ignored. Set to \code{FALSE} to list these reports.}

\item{clean_report_sources}{a logical indicating if indesirable files and
folders in the `report_sources` folder should be cleaned before
compilation; defaults to `FALSE` (no cleanup)}

\item{remove_cache}{a logical passed to `clean_report_sources`, indicating if
the `cache` folder should be considered as undesirable in `report_sources`;
defaults to `TRUE`, in which case `cache` will also be removed if
`clean_report_sources` is `TRUE`}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to \code{rmarkdown::render}.}

\description{
This function is used to compile several reports stored in the factory,
inside the \code{report_sources} folder (or any subfolder within). Outputs
will be generated in a named and time-stamped directory within
\code{report_outputs}. By default, only the most recent version of each
report is compiled, but an option permits to compile all reports. Reports are
expected to be \code{rmarkdown} documents (\code{.Rmd} extension), named
using the following convention: \code{[name]_[date].Rmd}, where \code{date}
must have the format \code{yyy-mm-dd}, for instance 2018-12-01 for the 1st
December 2018; \code{[name]} should be any explicit name, without blank
spaces or accentuated characters. For instance,
\code{bird_phylogeny_2017-04-01.Rmd} or \code{estimation_R_2018-02-04.Rmd}
are good file names.
